todict
======

This is a weekend project (thus, error prone for the moment being) that allows you to create your own dictionaries from scratch.

The purpose of this tool, is to provide you with an easy and quick way to write down any new translation/definition you learn,
and keep track of all of them in a single place. It's just a mixture of a TO DO app and a dictionary.

Although the most basic functionality is already there, the following features could include:
- A priority for each definition
- Home screen widget to show random definitions, based on each definition's priority
- A better UI design
- Synchronization (dropbox?)
